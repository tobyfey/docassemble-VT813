################################# PUBLIC BENEFITS ##############################
comment: |
  --Notes on how a list is gathered, using public_benefits as an example--
  
  Interview calls public_benefits.gather

  Gather looks for .there_are_any

  there_any_any asks for x.selected_types

  if any selected types,
   move_check_to_lists
     This creates a number of elements in the list, and deletes 'source' if other, (which may set 'source' to the default, like 'vehicle')
     also sets .moved for the list
     
  there_are_any is set to true

  will then look for complete

  check_for_others will set source

  complete calls for attribute (value for public_benefits) for information question
  
  information question calls display name (with reconsider to keep it fresh)
  
  answering the question sets display_name fresh with new source_other with validation code

  complete sets display

  What do you make in self-employed income each month as a ${ jobs[i].source }?

  Most people report their net income from self-employment. To figure your monthly net income:
  
  - Look at your gross income over the last 12 months of self-employment. 
  - Subtract your business expenses over that time.
  - Then divide by 12.
  
  Or you can:
  
  - Look at your most recent IRS Schedule C form from your federal taxes.
  - Divide the net income by 12.

question: |
  Is this interview right for you?
subquestion: |
  <h4>Do you need to fill out financial form 813A?</h4>

  There are a lot of questions on the 813A form. Be sure you really need to fill it out. It will take quite some time to describe all your income and expenses. This tool will help you work through it.

  You need to complete and file the 813A if:
  
  - You are a party in a newly filed divorce, civil union dissolution, legal separation, annulment or parentage action and you and the other party have minor children; OR
  
  - You or the other party are seeking to change a previously issued order for child support or spousal maintenance (alimony); OR
  
  - You are required to pay support and an enforcement action has been filed against you; OR
  
  - Your child is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families and support has been requested of you; OR
  
  - You are ordered by the court to complete and file this form or the other party requests that you fill out the form as part of a court case.

  If you aren't sure if you should fill it out, call the court.
  
  <h4>What you will need to know</h4>
  
  You will need to know:
  
  * birthdates of you, the other party and any children
  * any disability or Social Security income received by your kids
  * information about your court case like a docket number (You can find this information on other court papers you have about this case.)
  * any public assistance that you get (like 3SquaresVT food help, ReachUp help for families, SSDI, etc.)
  * the name and address of any employer you might have
  * your income -- If you work or get unemployment, have those paystubs on hand. If you get child support, have that information on hand. If you are self-employed, have your IRS Schedule C on hand or your business income and expenses. If you earn rental income, have the income amount and expenses on hand.
  * taxes taken out of your paycheck
  * if you work, you will need to know the costs of one-person, two-person and family health insurance offered by your employer -- whether you enroll in that insurance or not (Ask the human resources folks.)
  * all your expenses (including rent, utilities, insurance payments, child care, medical costs, car expenses, clothes, insurance, other child expenses, etc.)
  * loan payments for cars/trucks, your home or other real estate, credit card debt payments and any other loan payments.
